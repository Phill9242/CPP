# The CPP challenge
In this project, I've completed a collection of exercises designed to deepen my understanding of C++98. Each exercise module focuses on specific aspects of the language and has helped me build a strong foundation in C++ programming. The project is structured into nine modules, each with a distinct objective.

## Module Overview
### Module 00: Introduction to C++ Basics
In this module, I covered the basics of C++ programming, focusing on an introduction to classes, streams, and strings in C++. By completing this module, I now have a fundamental understanding of these core concepts.

### Module 01: Memory Management and Advanced Classes
In this module, I delved deeper into memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statements, and further exploration of classes. I learned how to manage memory effectively and work with more complex class structures.

### Module 02: Ad-hoc Polymorphism and Operator Overloading
This module allowed me to explore ad-hoc polymorphism and operator overloading in C++ to create more flexible and expressive code. I also covered the Orthodox Canonical class form, essential for writing clean and maintainable C++ code.

### Module 03: Inheritance and Virtual Classes
I focused on understanding inheritance in C++ and the use of virtual classes. I learned how to utilize inheritance to create modular, reusable code that adheres to the principles of object-oriented programming.

### Module 04: Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces
This module focuses on subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. I learned how to leverage these concepts to create extensible and maintainable code in C++.

### Module 05: Exceptions
I learned how to handle exceptions in C++ to write robust and error-resistant code. This module covers exception handling techniques and best practices.

### Module 06: C++ Casts
In this module, I explored the different types of C++ casts and when to use them. I covered static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast, as well as their appropriate use cases.

### Module 07: C++ Templates
I dove into C++ templates to create generic, reusable code. This module covers template syntax, specialization, and best practices for using templates effectively in my projects.

### Module 08: Templated Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms
I learned how to work with templated containers, iterators, and algorithms in C++. This module provided me with the skills needed to create efficient and flexible data structures and algorithms.

### Module 09: C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and Advanced Containers
In this final module, I focused on the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and deepened my understanding of containers. I learned how to leverage the power of the STL to write efficient, maintainable, and portable C++ code.

By completing all nine modules, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of C++98 and am well-equipped to tackle a wide range of programming challenges.
